 &mdash; This is a slice of the data used by reporters at BuzzFeed to report, [Hyperpartisan Facebook Pages Are Publishing False And Misleading Information At An Alarming Rate](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.qdLMPW0YE#.inaqzbBa0). 

**Details on the data:**

* Over the course of seven weekdays (Sept. 19 to 23 and Sept. 26 and 27), BuzzFeed News logged and fact-checked every single post published by nine sources: three mainstream and six hyper partisan sites. Posts could be rated “mostly true,” “mixture of true and false,” or “mostly false.”

* The Facebook reactions fields were obtained from Facebook (through an API) on October 11, 2016. For the details, here’s [the methodology](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check) that Buzzfeed used and was published with the story.
